## Websocket Information
### Connecting
The websocket server is on (wss://mpp.autoplayer.space). Any non-websocket requests to that port will be rejected.
### Messages
All messages sent by the client and the server are JSON arrays. Socket messages are strings, not binary. Each array can contain one or more individual message objects. Each individual message object has a "m" property where its value is a string signaling which message type it is.
#### Example socket message:
```json
[{"m":"hi","token":"abcdef"}]
```
### Close Reasons
#### HTTP Response Codes
- `400 Bad Request`: A non-websocket connection was made to the websocket port.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Too many clients tried to connect from the same IP address in a short period of time. Slow down connection rates, and make sure handshakes aren't failing.
#### Websocket Close Codes
All websocket close codes have a code (number) and a reason (string).
- `4000` - `Server closing.`: The server is closing, probably due to an update. Reconnect in a few seconds.
- `4001` - `Too many unique users per IP per hour.`: Each IP address can only use 3 unique non-bot tokens per hour. This is to discourage people from using so-called "proxy tokens" which let them evade mutes or bans without actually using a proxy.
- `4002` - `Exceeded x bytes per y seconds.`: There is a cap on how much data clients can send in a given period. This quota may change later, and the owner can manually increase it. Make sure you aren't sending extremely large messages.
- `4003` - `Message buffer length exceeded x.`: Internally, the server buffers messages so that things always get done in the right order, even if a message runs asynchronous code. Clients can hit this limit if they send too many messages too quickly, or if the server has an error. Errors in the server are rare and shouldn't happen. The owner is able to see if one happened.
- `4004` - `Timed out.`: Clients must send [t](#t-server-bound) messages every 20 seconds. They will get kicked if it has been longer than 30 seconds since the last time sync message was received. Time sync messages will not work before [hi](#hi-server-bound) has been sent.
- `4007` - `Exceeded x messages per y seconds.`: There is a cap on how many individual message objects can be sent in a period of time. If this cap is exceeded the socket is closed.
- `4008` - `Banned.`: The user is banned from the server. A notification should show a reason and amount of time remaining.
- `4009` - `Client limit reached.`: There is a limit on how many clients can be connected at a time per user. Contact the owner if you need to connect more clients.
- Between `4500` and `4999` - `Another client caused your IP to hit volation limit. Your IP is temporarily banned. Last violation reason: x`: A different client on the same IP address received a violation. Your IP hit the volation quota and that caused a temporary IP address ban. Subtract 500 from the code to see the original violation code.

## Important concepts
### Colors
All colors are hexadecimal strings.
#### Example
```js
"#ff8ff9"
```
### Times
All times are UNIX timestamps (number). All times that are sent and received by clients are the server's time. Clients adjust the times they send and receive to ensure it lines up with the server's time. It figures out how much to adjust by using "t" messages.
#### Example
```js
1627968429598
```

### String validation
For most messages that get sent to other clients, strings are checked to make sure they don't cause issues. Strings following string validation cannot be made entirely of spaces, and cannot be empty. Strings following string validation must not include any of the following characters:
- `\n`
- `\r`
- `\v`
- `\0`
- `\t`
- `\u202e`
- `\u2066`
- `\u2067`
- `\u202b`
- `\u200f`

### Participant info
In some messages, the server will send a participant info object instead of an id.
#### Properties
- `"id"`: The user's id (string).
- `"_id"`: The user's id (string). This is identical to the above field but is sent to keep backwards compatibility.
- `"name"`: The user's name.
- `"color"`: The user's color.
- `"x"`: The user's mouse x coordinate (string or number). This is usually between 0-100 for standard clients, but can be any number if set with scripts. 0 is on the left edge, 100 is on the right edge. Default value is 200 until set by the user.
- `"y"`: The user's mouse y coordinate (string or number). This is usually between 0-100 for standard clients, but can be any number if set with scripts. 0 is on the top edge, 100 is on the bottom edge. Default value is 100 until set by the user.
- `?"tag"`: The user's [Tag](#tag) object.
- `?"vanished"`: Whether the user is vanished (boolean). Regular users and bots will never see this property, however moderators will receive this if they or another user are vanished. If this property is not present, the user is not vanished.
#### Example
```json
{
  "_id":"207878f006108c9f0f1cf0cc",
  "id":"207878f006108c9f0f1cf0cc",
  "name":"AutoPlayer",
  "color":"#00b8f5",
  "tag":{ 
    "text": "Auto-Kun :3",
    "color": "#006687"
  },
  "x":50,
  "y":50
}
```

### Channel info
Contains information about a channel.
#### Properties
- `?"banned"`: Whether the client user is currently banned from this channel. If this property is not present, the user is not banned.
- `"count"`: The number of users currently in the channel.
- `"id"`: The name of this channel.
- `"_id"`: The name of this channel. Identical to `"id"`.
- `?"crown"`: The [crown](#crown) in this channel. This property is not present in lobbies because lobbies don't have crowns.
- `"settings"`: This channel's [settings](#channel-settings).
#### Example
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "chat": true,
    "color": "#440c09",

}
```

### Channel settings
Channel settings are an object with properties for each setting.
#### Properties

- `"color"`: The channel's inner background color.
- `?"color2"`: The channel's outer background color.
- `"chat"`: Whether chat is enabled in this channel (boolean).
- `"crownsolo"`: Whether anyone can play the piano (boolean). If this is false, only the crown holder can play the piano.
- `?"no cussing"`: Whether no cussing is enabled (boolean). If this is enabled, some things in chat will get replaced with asterisks for users who don't have the crown. If this property isn't present, "no cussing" is disabled.
- `"limit"`: The maximum amount of users that can join this channel (number). This is an integer between 0-99. If this is lowered while more users are in the channel, users won't get kicked. The crown holder and users who already have a participant in the channel bypass this limit.
- `?"lobby"`: Whether the channel is a lobby (boolean). Clients cannot change this property. If this property is not present, the channel is not a lobby.
#### Example
```json
{
  "lobby":true,
  "limit":20,

    "y":30.6
  },
  "endPos":{
    "x":75.8,
    "y":82.3
  }
}
```

### Note
Notes can either be a note start, or a note stop. Note starts have a "v" property singaling the velocity of the note, and note stops have an "s" property with the value of 1. It's impossible for a note to have both "v" and "s".
#### Properties
- `"n"`: This is the name of the note (string). Run `Object.keys(MPP.piano.keys)` in console to see a list of possible values.
- `?"d"`: Delay from the message's time to trigger this note event (number). The delay is in milliseconds and should be no more than 200. If this property is not present, the delay is 0.
